its not time to make a change
just relax take it easy
youre still young thats your fault
theres so much you have to know
find a girl settle down
if you want you can marry
look at me I am old but Im happy
i was once like you are now and I know that its not easy
to be calm when youve found something going on
but take your time think a lot
why think of everything youve got
for you will still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not
